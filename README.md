# E-Library

## Overview

E-Library is an online platform where users can create an account and store their books in a personal digital library. Built using modern web technologies, this application provides a seamless user experience for managing and accessing a personal book collection from anywhere. The project leverages MongoDB, NodeJS, and ExpressJS for the backend, with ReactJS and Shadcn powering the frontend UI.

## Features

- **User Accounts:** Users can sign up and log in to their personal accounts, allowing them to securely store and manage their book collections online.
- **Book Management:** Add, view, update, or delete books from your library. Each book can have details like title, author, genre, and description.
- **Responsive UI:** The interface is built using ReactJS and Shadcn, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience across all devices.
- **Secure Data Storage:** Utilizes MongoDB for secure and scalable data storage, ensuring user data is handled efficiently and safely.
- **Fast and Scalable Backend:** The backend is powered by NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing a robust and scalable environment for handling API requests and managing data.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **NodeJS:** JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- **ExpressJS:** Web framework for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing user and book data.

### Frontend:
- **ReactJS:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Shadcn:** UI component library used for creating a responsive and visually appealing design.

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can create an account by providing basic information. Authentication is managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure sessions.
   
2. **Book Management:**
   - Once logged in, users can add books to their library, specifying details like title, author, and genre. Books can be viewed, updated, or removed as needed.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - All user and book data is stored in MongoDB, allowing for efficient querying and scalability as the application grows.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - The frontend is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, ensuring that the E-Library can be accessed easily on any device.

## Future Enhancements

- **Search Functionality:** Implement advanced search and filtering options for users to easily find specific books in their library.
- **Book Sharing:** Allow users to share books or recommend books to other users.
- **Mobile App:** Develop a mobile version of the E-Library for on-the-go access.
